    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "London is one of the largest and most important cities of Europe with diverse population of close to 9 million people. It makes a considerable impact upon the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we aim to understand the structure of London better: is there a clear distinction between some areas and what is it? For that we will analyse different locations around the city and venues close to them. This should tell us how people use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside of pure academical interest, our research can help the goverement of London in city development planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "For the investigation, the following data sets have been used:\n",
    "1. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_areas_of_London) for areas of London.\n",
    "2. [Geocoder](https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/) for coordinates of the areas.\n",
    "3. [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/) a source of venues.\n",
